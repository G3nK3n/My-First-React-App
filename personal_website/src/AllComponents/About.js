                                    Hello, My name is Kenneth Serrano and I am currently a Computer Science student at Concordia University in Montreal.
                                    I am currently in my final year and have a strong passion for web development and Photography.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My Passion for Web Development came in during my E-Commerce class in CEGEP, where we had to make an
                                    E-commerce website using PHP and MySql. Just seeing how the website is build from the ground up and seeing how
                                    everything works just blew my mind. The fact that other people are using the web apps that have built makes me want
                                    to continue building more of them. I am constantly learning different web technologies and currently learning one of 
                                    the frameworks of JavaScript, ReactJS, in which I am using for this website.
                                </p>
                                { /* insert a paragraph about experiences here */ }
                                <p>
                                    I have been an amateur photographer for the past 3 years, taking portrait style photography using my Nikon D3400 and
                                    35mm lens 1.8G. I love the sharpness of the subject and popping out the colors, which also creates a beautiful blurred
                                    background. You can see some of my pictures in the Photography section.
                                    {/* Maybe move this paragraph in Photography section */ }
                                </p>
                            </div>
